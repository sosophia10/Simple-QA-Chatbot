# Simple-QA-Chatbot

## Overview
This project implements a simple **Question Answering (QA) system**. The system reads a pre-defined list of questions and answers from a text file and retrieves the answer based on user input. It is designed to provide quick, factual responses to frequently asked questions from various fields, including history, science, geography, and popular culture.

## Features
- **Preloaded Question Bank**: Includes a set of common questions covering different topics like history, geography, and science.
- **Text-Based Interaction**: Users input a question, and the system fetches the corresponding answer.
- **Expandable**: The system can easily be updated with new questions and answers by modifying the text file.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core language used to implement the QA system.
- **HTML/JavaScript (optional frontend)**: A simple web interface for interacting with the QA system.
